## Shell Scripting Tutorial:

Shell scripting allow you to automate `linux terminal tasks` by writing command in `.sh`file.

1. Use **nano filename.sh** to create  a file or open it.
2. Now write commands in such a way that automate tasks such as

     1. folder creation/deletion
     2. backup folder
     3. git opertaions
     4. software installation etc

3. Here is some  basic shell scripting practice;
 
    1. ```
       echo "Hello, $USER! Welcome to Shell Scripting"
       ```
    2. ```
        if [ "$name" = "Ali" ]; then
          echo "Hi Ali!"
        fi
        ```
    3. ```
       for i in 1 2 3; do echo $i; done
       ``` 
4. After writing the script save the file and in the terminal type `chmod +x filename.sh` to make it executable and then type `./filename.sh` to run it
